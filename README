# Klein to TM Compiler (WIP)

Produced by the **Compile Squad**

## Explanation of Files

#### Primary Source Code

- `src/compiler`: The home for all of the python source code
- `scanner.py`: Scans through the program and seperates each character of string of characters into tokens
- `position.py`: Custom position class to track the location in the program
- `token_agl.py`: Custom token class with a number of TokenTypes
- `token_lister.py`: Takes in a program and prints its token in an easily readable format
- `klein_errors.py`: Custom errors classes related to different stages of compiling
- `__init__.py`: These files are empty, but are required through to let python know that the current folder is a module.
- `__main__.py`: This file provides some scripts which are accessible to the user after installation
- `requirements.txt`: a list of all 3d party dependencies which get automatically installed when running make setup

#### Documentation Files

- `doc/*.jff`; Finite state machine files (which can be opened in JFLAP)
- `doc/klein-specification.txt`: Categorization of klein features with regular expressions and link to FSM files. Additionally contains a few notes on implementation

#### Project Files

- `.gitignore`: ignores specific files/folders which should not be stored in version control
- `LICENSE`: the project is tenatively licensed under the MIT license
- `pyproject.toml`: Specific configuration to support building the project and exporting specific app scripts
- `Makefile`: easily provides functionality to users related to installing and running the compiler
- `kleins`: a bash script to allow scanning any klein program
- `CS4550_Compiler.code-workspace` and `.vscode`: We all use vscode, so these files help our configurations to stay in sync.
- `.ruff.toml`: configurations for ruff (python linter and formatter) to help standardize code

#### Test Files

- `test_scanner.py`: contains a large number of tests to help validate and ensure functionality of the klein scanner
- `test_position.py`: contains a few tests for the position tracker

## Known Bugs

### Scanner:

- If you do an identifier or # over 1000 characters it will crash

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- These instructions assume that you are running a UNIX enviornment with the following packages/program available and installed
  - python3
  - make
  - git (optional)

### Installation

- (Optional) Clone the [repository](https://github.com/GGonnerman/CS4550_Compiler) and checkout the feature/scanner branch
- Open a terminal in the root of the project
- Run `make setup`
  - This will create a virtual environment (assuming one does not already exist) using venv
  - Then, it will install all required dependencies
- Thats it! Now your path depends on what you want to do

#### Running Kleins on a klein source code file

- Ensure that the `kleins` file in the project root is executable
  - If not, running `chmod +x kleins` should make it
- From the root, you can now run `./kleins path/to/source.kln`

#### Running the token lister (or any other python source file)

- Activate the virtual enviornment
  - This can be done by (from the root) running `source ./.venv/bin/activate`
- Two options:
  - 1 As a script:
    - You can now run `klein_list_tokens $'hello, world\n123'` and see the tokens used!
    - However, with this method you are limited to just this one command
  - 2 As a file:
    - Now you can run the token lister against programs like `python src/compiler/token_lister.py $'hello, world\n123'` and see the tokens used!
    - You can run any file, not just the token_lister - however, that file has the most interesting behavior.

#### Running Tests

##### Running All Tests

- From the root, run `make test_all`

###### Running a Specific Subset of Tests

- Activate the virtual enviornment
  - This can be done by (from the root) running `source ./.venv/bin/activate`
- From the root, execute `pytest tests/<chosen test suite>.py`
  - For example, to only run the tests for the scanner you could execute `pytest tests/test_scanner.py`
